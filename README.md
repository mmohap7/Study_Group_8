Start-up data visualisation - Final Project

Away from the spotlight of big business in thousands of garages and incubators, quite rebellions have been taking place. In this project, we will take a deep dive into the next generation of economic cells - startups. Through data analytics and visualisation, we try to find their funding patterns and communicate with their future success.

## Objectives

  - Trace the startups funding trend in recent years.
  - Draw a startups map, identifying the next Silicon Valley.
  - Utilise data modelling to select the features that might influence startups funding and outcomes.
  - Predict a startup's future based on its current characteristics.
  - Bring out customised advise to startups according to their segmentation.
